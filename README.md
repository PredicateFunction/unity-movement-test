## basic character controller in unity

first unity project hence it's simple

**allowing for**
  * Walking (WASD : hold)
  * Sprinting (Left Shift : hold)
  * Crouching (C || Left Control : hold)
  * Sliding (C || Left Control : hold)
  * Jump (Space : press) 


in case u wanna test it out, it's on the releases page

no idea how to properly setup a unity project
